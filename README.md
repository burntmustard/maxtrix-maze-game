## Rules

On a ten by ten map shown in the serial monitor, you can see your playerâ€™s location, and the location of the goal. The ten lights show either the x or y axis that your player is on, and different colors represent either obstacles, your player, the goal, or open spaces are off. Turning the switch changes back and forth between the x and y axis, and the buttons move you back and forth on whichever axis is being shown. The goal is to move through the maze avoiding the obstacles to get to the goal.

### Inputs:
Switch to change between axes
